# Framer Plugin - Syncing Quotes
A simple demonstration of the plugin I made as a part of the Framerverse. Uses API calls to a random quote generator to
instantiate a code component with text properties for both the author (with an optional visibility toggle) and the quote itself.

Further improvements could be made, like setting its initial location in the centre of the screen or at random co-ordinates.
However, I provided a video to show how to use the plugin for personal projects:
